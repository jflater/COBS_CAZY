        Mean aggregate potential enzyme activity (±1 SE) measured within aggregate fractions isolated by three methods: wet-sieving<comma> dry-sieving<comma> and optimal moisture-sieving. Values are averaged across ecosystem type. Enzymes measured were the N-cycling enzyme N-acetyl-glucosaminidase (NAG) and C-cycling enzymes β-glucosidase (BG)<comma> β-xylosidase (BX)<comma> and cellobiohydrolase (CB). Different letters denote statistically different means among fractions within a sieving method (α = 0.05).
